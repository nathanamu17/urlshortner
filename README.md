## Getting Started

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nathanamu17/urlshortner.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the `ui` directory:
   ```bash
   cd urlshortner/ui
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

To start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will run the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to access the application. The app will automatically reload if you edit the source files.

### Building for Production

To create a production build of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will optimize the application and output the build files in the `build` directory.

### Testing

To run tests:
